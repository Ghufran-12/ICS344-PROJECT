## Project Overview
This project involves three main phases:
1. Setup & Compromise: We used Kali Linux to attack a vulnerable Metasploitable3 service (SSH) using Metasploit and a custom exploit script.
2. SIEM Analysis: We integrated logs into Splunk to visualize and analyze the attack behavior.
3. Defensive Strategy: We implemented security measures to prevent the same attack and validated the improvement.

## Work Distribution
All group members collaborated equally on every phase of the project. We held regular meetings to complete the tasks together, ensuring shared understanding and contribution.
